/**
 * A use case for calculating the aerial distance (great-circle distance) between two geographical points.
 *
 * This class uses the Android `Location.distanceBetween` method to perform the calculation,
 * which provides an accurate approximation of the distance in meters over the Earth's surface.
 *
 * It is implemented as an invokable class, allowing it to be called like a function.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```
 * val calculateDistance = CalculateAerialDistanceUseCase()
 * val distanceInMeters = calculateDistance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2)
 * ```
